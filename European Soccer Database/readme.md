European Soccer Database - Data Analysis using SQL

Motivation

I embarked on this project to explore data analysis using SQL and demonstrate my ability to extract insights from complex datasets. The European Soccer Database, with its vast soccer-related data, provided an excellent opportunity to apply SQL techniques for data manipulation, aggregation, and analysis.

Key SQL Concepts Used

Before diving into the analysis, it's important to understand some key SQL concepts used in this project:

Database Connection: Establishing a connection and exploring tables.

Data Extraction: Retrieving details about countries, leagues, teams, and matches.

Basic Analytics: Performing foundational queries for insights.

Subqueries & Functions: Advanced data manipulation techniques.

Project Overview
