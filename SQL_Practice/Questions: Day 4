1. Running / cumulative sales year wise / rolling and months sales

WITH sum_sales AS (SELECT year(order_date) AS year_order, SUM(sales) AS sales
                    FROM orders
                    GROUP BY category, year(order_date)
                    ORDER BY category, year(order_date))


SELECT *, 
      SUM(sales) OVER (ORDER BY year_order, month_order_date ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEEDING AND 1 PRECEEDING) AS cumulative_sales
FROM sum_sales


2. Pivoting/ convert rows into column--year wise each category sales

SELECT 
  YEAR(order_date) AS order_year,
  MONTH(order_date) AS order_month,
  SUM(CASE WHEN category = 'furniture' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS furniture_sales,
  SUM(CASE WHEN category = 'office_supplies' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS office_supplies_sales,
  SUM(CASE WHEN category = 'technology' THEN sales ELSE 0 END) AS technology_sales
FROM orders 
GROUP BY 
  YEAR(order_date), 
  MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY 
  YEAR(order_date), 
  MONTH(order_date);

3. First Name , Middle Name and Last Name of a Customer/Employees

  WITH name AS (SELECT *
          , len(customer_name)-len(replace(customer_name, ' ','')) as no_of_spaces
          , CHARINDEX (' ', customer_name) as first_space_position
          , CHARINDEX (' ', customer_name, CHARINDEX (' ', customer_name)+1) as second_space_position
  FROM customers)
  
  SELECT *,
          CASE WHEN no_of_spaces=0 THEN customer_name
          ELSE SUBSTRING(customer_name, 1, first_space_position-1) END AS first_name
          CASE WHEN no_of_spaces<=1 THEN null 
          ELSE SUBSTRING (customer_name, 1, first_space_position+1,second_space_position-first_space_position-1) END AS middle_name
          CASE WHEN no_of_spaces<=1 THEN null 
          CASE WHEN SUBSTRING (customer_name, 1, first_space_position+1,len(customer_name)-first_space_position) 
          WHEN SUBSTRING (customer_name, 1, first_space_position+1,len(customer_name)-first_space_position)
          WHEN SUBSTRING (customer_name, 1, second_space_position+1,len(customer_name)-second_space_position)
          END AS last_name
          
  FROM name
