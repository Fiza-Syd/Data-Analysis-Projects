## 📊 YipitData Case Study

The task was designed to simulate real-world responsibilities involving data cleaning, transformation, and analysis.

### 🔍 Objective

Analyze Netflix Top 10 weekly viewership data to identify trends and generate user-based insights using Excel/Google Sheets or Power BI. The exercise focused on:

- Handling nulls and incomplete data (especially for the week of May 22, 2022)
- Estimating viewership using runtime and hours viewed
- Identifying top-performing Non-English films by cumulative weeks in the top 10
- Understanding risks in estimation and reporting
- Visualizing insights using Power BI (with calculated columns, measures, and cards)

### 🛠️ Tools & Skills Used

- Power BI
- Excel / Google Sheets
- DAX for custom calculations (e.g., Estimated Users, Avg Rating by Category)
- Data Cleaning & Joins (IMDb Ratings & Runtime)
- Pivot tables & charts
- Interactive report features (dropdowns, category filters, dynamic cards)

### 🧠 Key Learnings

- Estimated viewership can be misleading without accounting for rewatch behavior, shared accounts, or missing data
- Importance of excluding corrupted/incomplete data points (e.g., outage week)
- Power BI’s model view and measures can power dynamic reporting and handle grouped/filtered aggregations effectively
