1. What is the maximum number of women we can include such that their cumulative weight does not exceed 1000?
Solution 1:

WITH women_wgt AS (
    SELECT 
        *,
        SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY weight ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS cum_wgt,
        COUNT(*) OVER (ORDER BY weight ROWS BETWEEN UNBOUNDED PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW) AS ct_women
    FROM lift
    WHERE gender = 'F'
)
SELECT 
    COUNT(*) AS max_women, 
    MAX(ct_women) AS max_women2
FROM 
    women_wgt
WHERE 
    cum_wgt <= 1000;


Solution 2:


WITH women_data AS (
    SELECT 
        weight,
        SUM(weight) OVER (ORDER BY weight) AS cum_wgt,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY weight) AS ct_women
    FROM lift
    WHERE gender = 'F'
)
SELECT 
    MAX(ct_women) AS max_women
FROM 
    women_data
WHERE 
    cum_wgt <= 1000;
2. What is the average weight for each age group (30-40, 40-50, etc.)?


WITH age_grp AS (
    SELECT *, 
        CASE 
            WHEN age >= 30 AND age < 40 THEN '30-40'              
            WHEN age >= 40 AND age < 50 THEN '40-50'
            WHEN age >= 50 AND age < 60 THEN '50-60'
            WHEN age >= 60 AND age < 70 THEN '60-70'
            ELSE 'NA'
        END AS age_bracket	
    FROM lift
)
SELECT 
    age_bracket, 
    AVG(weight) AS avg_wgt
FROM 
    age_grp 
GROUP BY 
    age_bracket;
3. Identify the age groups where the average weight of women is greater than that of men.


WITH age_gender_avg AS (
    SELECT 
        CASE 
            WHEN age >= 30 AND age < 40 THEN '30-40'
            WHEN age >= 40 AND age < 50 THEN '40-50'
            WHEN age >= 50 AND age < 60 THEN '50-60'
            WHEN age >= 60 AND age < 70 THEN '60-70'
            ELSE 'NA'
        END AS age_bracket,
        gender,
        AVG(weight) AS avg_wgt
    FROM lift
    GROUP BY age_bracket, gender
),
pivoted AS (
    SELECT 
        age_bracket,
        MAX(CASE WHEN gender = 'F' THEN avg_wgt END) AS female_avg,
        MAX(CASE WHEN gender = 'M' THEN avg_wgt END) AS male_avg
    FROM age_gender_avg
    GROUP BY age_bracket
)
SELECT age_bracket, female_avg, male_avg
FROM pivoted
WHERE female_avg > male_avg;
4. What is each personâ€™s rank by weight within their gender?


WITH Wgt_ranking AS (
    SELECT 
        name, 
        weight, 
        gender,
        ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY gender ORDER BY weight DESC) AS rn
    FROM lift
)
SELECT 
    name, 
    gender, 
    rn, 
    weight
FROM 
    Wgt_ranking
ORDER BY 
    rn, gender;
