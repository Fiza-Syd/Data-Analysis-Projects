# E-Commerce Purchase Data Analysis

## Project Overview

This project is a basic data exploration of an e-commerce purchase dataset. The initial steps involve loading the data, inspecting its structure, and identifying any immediate issues such as missing values or data types that may need adjustment. This exploration serves as a foundation for further analysis, helping to understand the dataset's content and quality.
Loaded e-commerce purchase data and performed basic data exploration (head, tail, dtypes, missing values, column count, row count).
## Project Structure

- **data/**: Contains the dataset(s) used for this analysis.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks with code for data loading, initial exploration, and further analysis.
- **scripts/**: Python scripts for data cleaning and preprocessing tasks.
- **reports/**: Summarized reports or exported analysis outputs.

## Key Steps in Data Analysis

1. **Data Loading**: Load the e-commerce dataset for analysis.
2. **Initial Exploration**:
   - **Display First and Last Rows**: View sample rows with `head` and `tail` methods to understand the structure of the data.
   - **Data Types**: Check each column's data type to ensure compatibility with analysis tasks.
   - **Missing Values**: Identify any missing values in the dataset to determine if data cleaning is needed.
   - **Column and Row Counts**: Get the number of columns and rows for an overview of the datasetâ€™s size.

## Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical operations.
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn**: For data visualization (future steps).
- **Jupyter Notebook**: For interactive data exploration.

## Usage

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/syedfiza7546/Ecommerce-Purchases-.git
